OmegleIRC
=========

A simple interface for chatting on omegle through IRC using urlib

#####What works:
  * Connecting to omegle
  * Sending messages to omegle
  * Connecting to IRC
  * Simple commands for the bot
  * Console interface for chatting with omeglers without the bot
  
#####Cons:
  * Race conditions for printing in the console.py code
  * Some problems with threading
  * IRC-to-Omegle doesn't work well
  * Messy code, non-pythonic (Sorry, I'm a C++ coder)
